# Contributing to a St Mary's Church, Whitkirk repository

## Behaviour and safety

Anybody raising an issue or opening a pull request in one of our repositories is expected to follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## How to contribute

We write code to meet our own needs, and make most of it publicly available. We’re happy to share it. But we don’t always have the time to review people’s contributions, particularly if the project is no longer a priority for us or if the contribution doesn't align with our needs.

If you raise an issue or open a pull request, we will do our best to respond to it, but we can’t guarantee that we will fix or merge anything.

If you’re thinking about putting a lot of work into a pull request, and would like to get a better idea of whether we’d consider merging it, we advise that you first [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/issues) so that we can talk about it.

### Other ways to contribute

St Mary's is a charity which receives no government funding and is dependent on donations and fees to keep operating. If you've found our code useful and want to help support our work, please consider [leaving a donation](https://whitkirkchurch.org.uk/donate).
