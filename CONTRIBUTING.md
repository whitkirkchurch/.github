# Contributing to St Mary's Church, Whitkirk

## How to contribute

### I want to report a problem or suggest a feature

Just [open an issue](https://docs.github.com/issues) explaining what you're seeing or thinking. There's no guarantee we'll take action, especially if it's a feature request which doesn't align with our needs, but we promise to give it a look.

### I want to contribute a change to your code

The easiest way is to open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/pull-requests) with the changes you're proposing. Most of these tools are maintained for our own internal use, so if changes don't align with what we need then we might not accept the change, but we promise to give it a look.

### Other ways to contribute

St Mary's is a charity which receives no government funding and is dependent on donations and fees to keep operating. If you've found our code useful and want to help support our work, please consider [leaving a donation](https://whitkirkchurch.org.uk/donate).
